## Learning Objectives
(as noted in the lab instructions)
- Utilize spatial analysis skills to build a simple site suitability model.   
- Illustrate the suitability model in a GIS geoprocessing flowchart. 
- Create visually pleasing maps to illustrate and interpret the results.  

This lab was the culmination of the course - we received few instructions and needed to rely on previous knowledge from prior labs in order to figure it out. I made a mistake in my geoprocessing environment that ended up cutting off my results on the map. After realizing this mistake, I went back through and fixed each map. For some criteria as well as the final product, it didn't make a difference, but it was an excellent process for me to go back through and do it all again. It really cemented the use of some tools, and helped confirm that you can use different tools and functions to acheive the same result.
