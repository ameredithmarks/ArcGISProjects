# ArcGISProjects

This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase work I have done as part of my GIS certificate coursework with Northwest Missouri State University. I will add to it as I complete coursework. All work, unless otherwise noted, was completed in ArcGIS Pro using a student license. 

Some coursework, including GIS & Spatial Analytics, and Digitial Image Processing, included assignments that do not lend themselves well to display here. There is a separate file for these classes to describe objectives and outcomes.
